# Eco-Fly
Our project consist of use a Tello drone for monitor trails and detect obstacles on ones.
The drone is controlled by a leap and all programs are programmed in Python. 
The leap is a three-dimensional control system connected to the computer, based on hand movements that detects the gestures.
We add on the drone a termic sensor that can detects people or animals on the trail.
Thanks to the video camera of Tello, we can see if there are people or animals in distress and, in this case, call the appropriate rescues. 
It can also detects if there are rubbish on the track.
